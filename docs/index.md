# Welcome to Django Tailwind's documentation!

# Definitions

This document uses the *Tailwind* word when we talk about two things: the CSS framework and the Django package.

So let's agree that we'll use:
* **Django Tailwind**, when we talk about this very package;
* **Tailwind CSS**, when we talk about the CSS framework;

So **Django Tailwind** was created to make **Tailwind CSS** and Django play together (ðŸ’š).
